# Nondescript Bot

This bot makes it easy to copy [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org) summaries into the [Open Library](http://openlibrary.org) pages for books that don't have descriptions, or have inadequate descriptions. The first version of the bot will require user approval for each action, but future versions may be more automated.
