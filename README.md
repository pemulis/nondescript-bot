# Nondescript Bot

This bot will make it easy to add summaries from [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) to [Open Library](http://openlibrary.org)! Originally it was going to work through a Python command-line interpreter, but I split that off into a separate project called [ol-commander](https://github.com/pemulis/ol-commander). Now I'm in the process of rewriting the [Open Library Ruby wrapper](https://github.com/pemulis/openlibrary-wrapper), so that I can write the bot in Ruby.
